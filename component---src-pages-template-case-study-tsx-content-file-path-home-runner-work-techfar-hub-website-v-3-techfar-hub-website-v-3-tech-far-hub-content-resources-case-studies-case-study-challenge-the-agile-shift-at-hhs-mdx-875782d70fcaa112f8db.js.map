In recent years, HHS utilized the traditional acquisition approach to deploy a Centralized Storage System (CSS), a secure platform for storing sensitive clinical trial information. This project, intended to streamline data sharing and improve accessibility for researchers nationwide, quickly became a textbook example of how acquisition can fail.\\nThe team meticulously planned the project, outlining a comprehensive scope and a detailed schedule spanning several years. Multiple Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and senior management supported the initiative, while rigorous legal review and guidance from outside consultants ensured the project's thorough preparation for success. The project utilized the waterfall model, characterized by its linear, sequential approach. This methodology relies on comprehensive planning at the project's outset, with each phase (conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, implementation, and maintenance) completed before the next begins.

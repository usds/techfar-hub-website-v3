Additionally, SAP provides many streamlined procedures, like comparative analysis, which has the potential to significantly improve VA’s ability to find the right vendor to meet its technical needs.

This requires Government to try as best as possible to state things in plain language or to be extra explicit in its instructions where maybe it wouldn’t be under different circumstances.  It is easy to overlook these types of issues as generally they are common knowledge and well understood, and vendors do have the opportunity to ask questions during the Due Diligence step, but this isn’t always enough.  Its understandably frustrating for vendors that have spent a lot of time and effort on a solicitation to feel like they lost based on a technicality (even if it’s really not a technicality) because they did not fully understand the solicitation requirements, case law, or standard procedures well enough.

I am not sure, but we should be asking that each time we develop an innovative evaluation process and I think should limit procedures to only those necessary to properly evaluate their capabilities.

This helped shorten our overall schedule greatly and avoided having to read a fifty-page technical volume that may have been written by a consultant hired solely for that purpose. The Comparative Analysis allowed us to compare differing technical solutions without the burden of developing pre-determined technical discriminators.  There are certainly things we will refine in future acquisitions but we felt the acquisition was very successful and did for us exactly what we were hoping to do—find the best possible innovative solution in the shortest and easiest way possible for all parties.

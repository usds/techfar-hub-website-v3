To meet the demands of the initiative, agencies are directed to consider ways to extend their current resources to maximize value, reskill and retain staff, and enhance security situations. The goal of the adoption of cloud computing software is to harness the power of new technologies that expand capabilities within each agency to serve the public.\nOne successful adoption of a cloud-based CRM within the US government is the General Services Administration (GSA) using Salesforce, a leading cloud-based CRM platform, to manage interactions with various stakeholders and improve service delivery.\nThe ",i.createElement(t.a,{href:"https://www.cio.gov/about/vision/#:~:text=The%20Chief%20Information%20Officers%20Council%20%28CIO%29%20Council%20is,use%2C%20sharing%2C%20and%20performance%20of%20Federal%20information%20resources."},"Chief Information Officers Council")," worked with the OMB, the General Services Administration, and other agencies to determine opportunities for optimizing agency usage of cloud services.

While Alex is familiar with it, adoption has been slow across agencies, so direct experience with how such tools integrate into the existing systems is limited. The IT department knows that implementing these solutions has become a priority for many agencies, but integrating cloud-based systems into the agency’s legacy infrastructure would be a logistical nightmare. To try to anticipate the challenges these new solutions may present, Alex and the IT team have conducted some preliminary research into the implications of a cloud-based system, but have not shared their findings broadly.\nBeyond the technical aspects, Alex has experienced the adoption of new systems before and knows the human element of new software adoption can present significant challenges, including training staff on new software, universal adoption of systems, and the quality and consistency of use.

Legacy systems in this agency are over two decades old. Getting them to speak to the cloud—without causing disruptions—won’t be easy.”\nCasey listens closely, knowing that Alex's concerns are valid. But the real issue, Alex notes, is not just technical. “The human element,” Alex continues, “that’s where we’ve seen real resistance. You’ve got career employees who hate change. They’ll fight it at every step.”\nCasey nods, recalling the murmurs of discontent from employees whenever anything new was introduced.

In a report to the President, it was clear that agencies should emphasize “data-level protections and fully leverage modern virtualized technologies.” Protecting data is the primary concern for Compliance Officers, generally, but particularly when considering cloud-based solutions.\nRiley is relieved to be talking with Alex so early in the acquisition process. The best way to lower risk is to openly communicate and collaborate with the IT team as they think about implementation and infrastructure needs. When they meet, Alex shares the IT team’s concerns regarding integration. “The problem,” Riley started, “is that we’ve seen other agencies rush through the cloud acquisition process and end up violating compliance. Contracts were mishandled, data security was compromised, and vendors didn’t meet the standards.” These concerns are valid, but ones that can be overcome.\nFor Riley, the larger concern is compliance with the FAR and ensuring data security–these are non-negotiables.

We’re having a hard time coming to a consensus on a single approach.” Casey recognizes that negotiation and relationship-building skills would be an asset to these ongoing conversations and proposes an Integrated Project Team (IPT). Casey knows that IPTs provide a more holistic approach to project management, allowing representatives from different areas to effectively work together throughout the project's life cycle. On the other hand, IPTs can be difficult to manage because of diverse team member backgrounds and the need for consensus building. “I really think I can help here,” Casey responds. “If the three of us work together, I can learn more about the sources of the issues and their level of impact on any solution we identify.”"),"\n",i.createElement(t.h4,{id:"the-interaction---acquisitions-office-it-and-compliance-office"},"The Interaction - Acquisitions Office, IT, and Compliance Office"),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"During their joint working sessions, Casey asks Alex and Riley to share the major issues the acquisition presents.\n“We’re talking about major disruptions,” Alex warned. “Either we update our legacy systems, which will cost us months, or we risk serious operational downtime with the new cloud system.

Not to mention, they’re the ones who have to directly engage with user resistance.”\nRiley adds, “With proper planning, testing, and cross-departmental coordination, these challenges can be mitigated. We would have to create a strong strategic plan for a successful implementation. Updating legacy systems to meet the new demands of the cloud system, raises major concerns for me as I think about ensuring regulatory compliance. Newly developed solutions may require compliance reviews, risk management policies, and additional implementation strategies.” Alex’s face shows some disagreement. “But, updating legacy systems might mean fewer complications because the tools have already been audited and approved.” Alex leans back in the chair with arms crossed.\nRiles continues, “From a security perspective, whether we update legacy systems or develop newly built custom integrations, data security is a critical concern.

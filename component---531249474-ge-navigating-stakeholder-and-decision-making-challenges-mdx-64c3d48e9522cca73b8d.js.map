The exercise also includes facilitator instructions and tips for delivery. Learner instructions guide them through navigating the case study and completing each exercise milestone.\\nLearners will analyze proposed solutions, considering the benefits and drawbacks of each option. There is no single correct solution for this case study, and learners will be encouraged to explore the many potential pathways, and consider them using tools that include a cost-benefit analysis and a Strengths - Weaknesses - Opportunities - Threats (SWOT) analysis to uncover additional insights. Based on their analyses and feedback from peers and the facilitator, learners will propose a creative solution with a written analysis and a final presentation.\\nThe exercise is broken down into five milestones to engage learners as they fully analyze the scenario while receiving feedback throughout the experience. This encourages learners to adjust their positions as they learn new information, gain additional insights, and further develop their approach.

While Casey has acquired many software solutions, acquiring a cloud-based system like this one would be a first.

Casey was acutely aware that this project would have ripple effects—some beneficial, some dangerous. If successful, Casey would solidify their standing as a top specialist, potentially opening doors to career advancement. But failure could attract congressional scrutiny and public outcry, not to mention the internal politics of the agency, where trust had been hard-earned.

Legacy systems in this agency are over two decades old. Getting them to speak to the cloud—without causing disruptions—won’t be easy.”\\nCasey listens closely, knowing that Alex's concerns are valid.

In a report to the President, it was clear that agencies should emphasize “data-level protections and fully leverage modern virtualized technologies.” Protecting data is the primary concern for Compliance Officers, generally, but particularly when considering cloud-based solutions.\\nRiley is relieved to be talking with Alex so early in the acquisition process. The best way to lower risk is to openly communicate and collaborate with the IT team as they think about implementation and infrastructure needs. When they meet, Alex shares the IT team’s concerns regarding integration. “The problem,” Riley started, “is that we’ve seen other agencies rush through the cloud acquisition process and end up violating compliance. Contracts were mishandled, data security was compromised, and vendors didn’t meet the standards.” These concerns are valid, but ones that can be overcome.\\nFor Riley, the larger concern is compliance with the FAR and ensuring data security–these are non-negotiables.

We’re having a hard time coming to a consensus on a single approach.” Casey recognizes that negotiation and relationship-building skills would be an asset to these ongoing conversations and proposes an Integrated Project Team (IPT). Casey knows that IPTs provide a more holistic approach to project management, allowing representatives from different areas to effectively work together throughout the project's life cycle. On the other hand, IPTs can be difficult to manage because of diverse team member backgrounds and the need for consensus building. “I really think I can help here,” Casey responds. “If the three of us work together, I can learn more about the sources of the issues and their level of impact on any solution we identify.”\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.h4, {\n    id: \"the-interaction---acquisitions-office-it-and-compliance-office\"\n  }, \"The Interaction - Acquisitions Office, IT, and Compliance Office\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"During their joint working sessions, Casey asks Alex and Riley to share the major issues the acquisition presents.\\n“We’re talking about major disruptions,” Alex warned. “Either we update our legacy systems, which will cost us months, or we risk serious operational downtime with the new cloud system.

Not to mention, they’re the ones who have to directly engage with user resistance.”\\nRiley adds, “With proper planning, testing, and cross-departmental coordination, these challenges can be mitigated. We would have to create a strong strategic plan for a successful implementation. Updating legacy systems to meet the new demands of the cloud system, raises major concerns for me as I think about ensuring regulatory compliance. Newly developed solutions may require compliance reviews, risk management policies, and additional implementation strategies.” Alex’s face shows some disagreement. “But, updating legacy systems might mean fewer complications because the tools have already been audited and approved.” Alex leans back in the chair with arms crossed.\\nRiles continues, “From a security perspective, whether we update legacy systems or develop newly built custom integrations, data security is a critical concern.

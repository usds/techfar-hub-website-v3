## Why Performance-Based Contracting & Agile Are a Good Fit

Acquisition professionals use performance based contracting techniques to let the contractor's "be the experts" when it comes to technical delivery. By describing the work in terms of the results desired, as opposed to how the work should be done, performance based techniques closely mirror agile values. These types of contracts give the contractor "maximum flexibility" to devise the best method to accomplish the required result, making it ideal for agile development. Use the templates and examples on this page to create your own performance-based contracting approach for your next agile service requirement.

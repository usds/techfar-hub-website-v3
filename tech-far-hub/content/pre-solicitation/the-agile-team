## Who is the Agile Team

A key feature of Agile software development is the emphasis on the team approach. A cross-functional or Integrated Product Team (IPT) is integral to the success and administration of Agile software development contracts. The [members of the agile team](/resources/learning-center/examples-agile-team-members/) need to include key stakeholders from the program and acquisition office, and should be led by a program manager holding the appropriate level of Federal Acquisition Certification in Program/Project Management. It is essential that team members are champions for Agile, as the cultural change from traditional methods to Agile may be challenging. 

To make this shift happen as seamlessly as possible, before conducting pre-award activities, the key members of the team should be familiar with Agile software development and open to learning new ways of thinking. Contracting officers and contracting officerâ€™s representatives need not be trained as software developers, but should have a working knowledge of the concepts and processes associated with agile development. The United States Digital Service sponsors the [Digital IT Acquisition Program (DITAP)](get-started/ditap/), a core-plus specialization for the 1102 job series, for contracting professionals who want to learn how to plan, award, and administer agile contracts.

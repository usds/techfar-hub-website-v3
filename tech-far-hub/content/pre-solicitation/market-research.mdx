<Summary>
- Well-versed agile vendors should value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
- Past performance examples or innovative methods like challenges and demonstrations are ways vendors can prove that they know how to properly use agile techniques.
</Summary>
## What to look for in an Agile Vendor

Vendors who are well versed in Agile development appreciate the four values and [twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) espoused in the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/). They work iteratively to design and build digital services, and incorporate regular testing and feedback into their plans. Per the Agile Manifesto, they value individuals and interactiosn over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. 

Companies may say they follow agile development methods, but in actuality there are many methods of deploying agile techniques such as Scrum, Lean, DevOps, eXtreme Programming (XP), and DSDM. The only way to truly know if a vendor is well-versed in agile development is to have them prove it, whether through past performance examples or innovative methods like challenges and demonstrations. When performing market research for agile development projects, explore innovative methods like those described in the [FAI Periodic Table of Acquisition Innovation](https://www.fai.gov/periodic-table), or talk to forward-thinking groups of professionals like those at [USDS](https://www.usds.gov/), [18Fn](https://18f.gsa.gov/), or the [DHS Procurement Innovation Lab](https://www.dhs.gov/pil).

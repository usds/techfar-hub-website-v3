## Agile Requirements Development

### FAR 15.203 requires agencies to identify requirements in their requests for proposals (RFPs).  How does this requirement fit with Agile processes, which are based on the premise that it is not realistic to expect users to know exactly what they need before they see it and rely on refinement of system requirements based on testing and customer feedback after the contract is awarded? 

Agile software development, as with any software development, requires thorough [acquisition planning](/pre-solicitation/planning-for-agile/). Lack of proper acquisition planning and failure to follow FAR subpart 7.1 can be fatal to any procurement, but especially software development procurements. With Agile software development, requirements and priorities are captured in a high level Product Vision, which establishes a high level scope of the project, describes expected outcomes, and produces high level budgetary estimates. The government component of the agile team defines the core capabilities of the project which are required to meet the mission objective and provide business value.

Agile software development can satisfy core principles related to requirements development by writing a Product Vision and coupling it with an explanation of how the Agile process will be used to achieve the Product Vision. Rather than providing a set of “how to specifications” (or Requirements Traceability Matrix), the Product Vision focuses on desired outcomes, similar to performance-based contracting, which has been permitted by the FAR for many years.

Many agencies get caught up on requirements definition for agile development because what they traditionally think of as requirements are really system design specifications, like the blueprints of a house. In agile development, we think more about the end state of the house rather than the architectural diagrams. An agile requirements document would still comply with FAR provisions like [FAR 15.203](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-15.2#FAR_15_203__d904e10) without trapping the contractors into a waterfall methodology using a very familiar concept: performance-based contracting. For many years the FAR has provided for performance-based service contracts, where the Government issues a statement of objectives (SOO) defining its outcomes that allows for industry to provide innovative solutions that are measured under a quality assurance surveillance plan. This same approach is applied to contracts using an Agile software development methodology.

An agile requirements package that includes elements like a Product Vision, definition of done, and Product Roadmap would still comply with FAR provisions like 15.203(a)(1) without trapping the contractors into a waterfall methodology. Refer to this [Sample Language for Government Contracts for Agile Software Development Services](/resources/learning-center/sample-language-for-government-contracts/) as a baseline for developing your requirements document.

## Using the Product Vision to Develop Functional Contract Requirements

In our [Agile Overview](/pre-solicitation/agile-overview/), we discussed the difference between technical requirements and functional requirements, where technical requirements are developed during the period of performance to achieve the desired functional requirements. The example below demonstrates how a Product Vision can be broken down into functional requirements through the agile planning process. Once the functional requirements are defined, the agile team works to identify the necessary technical requirements during release and sprint planning.

**Techniques for Developing a Product Vision**

A good technique to help you get started on a Product Vision is to use the following structure:

- For (target customer)
- Who (statement of the need or opportunity)
- The (product name) is a (product category)
- That (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
- Unlike (primary competitive alternative)
- Our product (statement of primary differentiation)

Here is how this structure looks when applied to two example requirements.

### Sample Product Visions for Agile Development

**Collaboration Platform** — For stakeholders who need to maintain a centralized view of all customer interactions, the collaboration platform will track behaviors and facilitate outreach to citizens engaging with the Agency through all communication channels. Unlike the costly and outdated legacy systems, this new collaboration platform will replace all critical and major business processes with a user-friendly, responsive design at a reasonable cost. 
 
**Electronic Benefits System** — For benefits recipients who need an easier way to apply for and check the status of their benefits, the electronic benefits system will allow customers to easily create and submit a new benefits application, get the status of a new application, and review the status of their benefits. Unlike the old paper-based system, the electronic benefits system will provide a faster processing time and will increase the transparency into the status of the benefits application, two key needs identified by user research. We expect the new system to also address several agency needs such as increasing the ability of the agency to identify fraudulent claims, and reducing the level of effort required for an agency claims specialist to process a benefits application.

When issuing a solicitation, it should explain the Agile software development process.  The Product Owner’s high-level requirements will guide the process, and the Agency Product Owner will work together with the Agile team to develop and estimate user stories and establish acceptance criteria (specifying the expected functionality for a user story). The Agile team will work on multiple user stories within a series of sprints which, taken together, form the software release(s) within the provided sprint/release timeframes. The solicitation should also describe the required testing of functional requirements and make it clear that testing should be integrated into each sprint cycle. As part of the Agile process, the Government will approve the specific plans for each iteration, establish the priorities, approve plan revisions reflecting the experience from completed iterations, and approve the working software to determine whether it meets the stated requirements.

#### Solicitation Description of an Agile Process

“The contractor will work in a team-based Agile environment.  The Agency will create and maintain system roadmaps, project plans, and product and release backlogs that will be the basis for the contractor’s work. The Product Owner will specify high-level requirements to the Agile team. As in typical Scrum-based Agile processes, the Agency Product Owner will work together with the team to develop and estimate user stories and establish acceptance criteria. These acceptance criteria will specify expected functionality for a user story, as well as any non-functional requirements that must be met in the development of the story. The Agency Product Owner, supported by SMEs and business analysts, will determine whether or not acceptance criteria have been satisfied.”

## Specifying Agile Needs in a Manner that Promotes Competition 

### FAR 11.002 states that agencies should specify needs in a manner that promotes competition.  Given that requirements may not be fully defined when the agency solicits offers and that not every offeror knows how to perform Agile software development, what is the best way to ensure effective use of competition? 

The Government ensures effective competition by applying a similar process used for performance-based contracting by identifying the desired outcome rather than the details of the design for how to perform the work.  There are many vendors that are well-versed in Agile software development, and that number will likely increase as agencies become more familiar with Agile processes and gain experience. 

To ensure effective use of competition, the Government must identify a Product Vision with enough information to describe the scope of the project and allow offerors to make a reasoned business judgment whether they want to compete.  This is similar to the process used for performance-based contracting where the Government develops an SOO that describes the desired outcome for the effort rather than provides instructions on how the work is to be performed. 

As in any other acquisition, requirements development should be coupled with appropriate market research and early vendor engagement by issuance of an request for information to inform the development of a solicitation, issuance of draft RFPs/RFQs, holding industry days and other mechanisms that allow prospective offerors to ask questions. 

Simply because every vendor may not perform Agile software development does not mean that the process should be viewed as unduly restrictive of competition.  As long as the agency’s strategy is justified, it should not be at risk of such a challenge being successful.  As explained throughout this document, there are many reasons why Agile software development is beneficial in helping to manage risk and drive results.  In addition, the number of contractors that are skilled in this methodology is likely to increase as agencies become more familiar with Agile software development processes and gain experience.

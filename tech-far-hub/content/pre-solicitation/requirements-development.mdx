<Summary>
- Statement of objectives (SOO) define outcomes which allows industry to provide innovative solutions that are measured under a quality assurance surveillance plan.
- Product visions capture requirements and priorities at a high level, which establishes a high level definition of the scope of the project, specifies expected outcomes, and produces high level budgetary estimates.

## Agile Requirements Development

***
<a name="requirements"></a>
### FAR 15.203 requires agencies to identify requirements in their requests for proposals (RFPs).  How does this requirement fit with Agile processes, which are based on the premise that it is not realistic to expect users to know exactly what they need before they see it and rely on refinement of system requirements based on testing and customer feedback after the contract is awarded? 

Agencies using Agile software development can meet the requirements of FAR 15.203 by identifying a Product Vision and coupling it with an explanation of how the Agile process will be used to achieve the Product Vision.  Rather than providing a set of “how to specifications” (or Requirements Traceability Matrix), the Product Vision will focus on a desired outcome, similar to performance-based contracting, which has been permitted by the FAR for many years.   

For many years the FAR has provided for performance-based service contracts, where the Government issues a statement of objectives (SOO) defining its outcomes that allows for industry to provide innovative solutions that are measured under a quality assurance surveillance plan.  This same approach is applied to contracts using an Agile software development methodology. 	

Agile software development, as with any software development, requires thorough acquisition planning, which is critical to the success of an acquisition.  Lack of proper acquisition planning and failure to follow FAR subpart 7.1, can be fatal to any procurement, but especially software development procurements.  With Agile software development, requirements and priorities are captured in a high level Product Vision, which establishes a high level definition of the scope of the project, specifies expected outcomes, and produces high level budgetary estimates.  The Integrated Product Team (IPT - cross functional team), defines the core capabilities of the project which are required to meet the mission objective and provide business value.  Requirements might be stated as a SOO as used in conjunction with performance-based contracts.  The offeror would respond to the SOO with a Performance Work Statement (PWS) which details how the SOO will be fulfilled under the contract. See Appendix C: Sample Language for Government Contracts for Agile Software Development Services.

**A typical format for a Product Vision would specify:**

- For (target customer)
- Who (statement of the need or opportunity)
- The (product name) is a (product category)
- That (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
- Unlike (primary competitive alternative)
- Our product (statement of primary differentiation)

#### Sample Product Visions

**Collaboration Platform** — For the Agency’s components that that need a collaboration platform as the primary workflow application to maintain a centralized view of all interactions and outreach to citizens engaging with the Agency through various methods.  Unlike the costly and outdated legacy systems, this new collaboration platform will replace all critical and major businesses processes with a more efficient, 21st century system at a reasonable cost. 
 
**Electronic Benefits System** — For benefits recipients who need an easier way to apply for and check the status of their benefits, the electronic benefits system will allow customers to easily create and submit a new benefits application, get the status of a new application, and will allow the customer to review the status of their benefits. Unlike the old paper-based system, the electronic benefits system will provide a faster processing time and will increase the transparency into the status of the benefits application, two key needs identified by user research. We expect the new system to also address several agency needs such as increasing the ability of the agency to identify fraudulent claims, and reducing the level of effort required for an agency claims specialist to process a benefits application.

When issuing a solicitation[*16*], it should explain the Agile software development process.  The Product Owner’s high-level requirements will guide the process, and the Agency Product Owner will work together with the Agile team to develop and estimate user stories and establish acceptance criteria (specifying the expected functionality for a user story).  The Agile team will work on multiple user stories within a series of sprints which, taken together, form the software release(s) within the provided sprint/release timeframes.  The solicitation should also describe the required testing of functional requirements and make it clear that testing should be integrated into each sprint cycle.  As part of the Agile process, the Government will approve the specific plans for each iteration, establish the priorities, approve plan revisions reflecting the experience from completed iterations, and approve the working software to determine whether it meets the stated requirements.

#### Solicitation Description of an Agile Process

“The contractor will work in a team-based Agile environment.  The Agency will create and maintain system roadmaps, project plans, and product and release backlogs that will be the basis for the contractor’s work. The Product Owner will specify high-level requirements to the Agile team. As in typical Scrum-based Agile processes, the Agency Product Owner will work together with the team to develop and estimate user stories and establish acceptance criteria. These acceptance criteria will specify expected functionality for a user story, as well as any non-functional requirements that must be met in the development of the story. The Agency Product Owner, supported by SMEs and business analysts, will determine whether or not acceptance criteria have been satisfied.”

## Specifying Agile Needs in a Manner that Promotes Competition 

***
<a name="effective-competition"></a> 
### FAR 11.002 states that agencies should specify needs in a manner that promotes competition.  Given that requirements may not be fully defined when the agency solicits offers and that not every offeror knows how to perform Agile software development, what is the best way to ensure effective use of competition? 

The Government ensures effective competition by applying a similar process used for performance-based contracting by identifying the desired outcome rather than the details of the design for how to perform the work.  There are many vendors that are well-versed in Agile software development, and that number will likely increase as agencies become more familiar with Agile processes and gain experience. 

To ensure effective use of competition, the Government must identify a Product Vision with enough information to describe the scope of the project and allow offerors to make a reasoned business judgment whether they want to compete.  This is similar to the process used for performance-based contracting where the Government develops an SOO that describes the desired outcome for the effort rather than provides instructions on how the work is to be performed. 

As in any other acquisition, requirements development should be coupled with appropriate market research and early vendor engagement (e.g., issuance of an request for information to inform the development of a solicitation, issuance of draft RFPs/RFQs, holding industry days and other mechanisms that allow prospective offerors to ask questions). 

Simply because every vendor may not perform Agile software development does not mean that the process should be viewed as unduly restrictive of competition.  As long as the agency’s strategy is justified, it should not be at risk of such a challenge being successful.  As explained throughout this document, there are many reasons why Agile software development is beneficial in helping to manage risk and drive results.  In addition, the number of contractors that are skilled in this methodology is likely to increase as agencies become more familiar with Agile software development processes and gain experience.
